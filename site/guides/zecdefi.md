# Using Zcash in DeFi


## RenBridge & renZEC

Zcash users are capable of leveraging Ethereum smart contracts and wider DeFi applications while preserving their privacy via [@renprotocol](https://twitter.com/renprotocol) using this 4-Step process:


### Step 1: Acquire Shielded ZEC 

Purchase ZEC from any Exchange & Proceed to withdraw to your personal non-custodial wallet such as Nighthawk, ZecWallet Lite or Ywallet.  

If withdrawal was deposited to a T-adddress, Auto-shield funds or make an additional transaction to Z-address.

This means that the money within your wallet is no longer tied back to your identity.

Similar to withdrawing cash from a bank, once withdrawn the bank can no longer monitor your transactions. 



### Step 2: Convert Zcash to Ether 

Using an Exchange swap your Shielded ZEC for ETH:

[Changelly](https://changelly.com)

[LetsExchange](https://letsexchange.io)


### Step 3: Using DeFi 

Now you have received ETH you are capable of interacting with the multitude of Web3 applications & services via Metamask & Trust wallet for DeFi, NFT's, DAOs etc!



### Step 4: Convert ETH back to ZEC using RenBridge

Once you're ready to cash out, convert your ETH to renZEC using:

   [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=mainnet)
 
   [SushiSwap](https://app.sushi.com/swap)


Now head over to [RenBridge](https://bridge.renproject.io/mint) 

-Select "Releasing" 

-Paste your destination address and convert your renZEC back to Transparent ZEC (Only T-address currently available).

Within your non-custodial wallet auto-convert your Transparent ZEC to Shielded ZEC.


**Congratulations!! you have successfully used your Zcash to onboard to & use DeFi applications in a privacy-preserving way with renZEC**

## Innovation around Zcash DeFi 

**Layer 1 Solution**

Options are currently being explored to enable DeFi applications within the Zcash ecosystem using the current Layer 1. This could be possible by perofrming most of the contract operations off-chain with a sequencer & have the validation of those actions done on chain. A version of this was created in partnership with JP Morgan on their enterprise blockchain. As of NU5 a mechanism exists (TZE) to add this type of extension to Zcash. 

**zkEVM**

This would bring native programmability to Zcash. Multiple options have been found for DeFi functionality including the corresponding implementation difficulty for Token Exchange/Token Issuance/Minting/Governance Functionality among more:

Continuing research into Proof-of-Stake & the Cosmos Interblockchain Communication Protocol is led by the ECC.

**ZSA/UDA's**

Zcash Shielded Assets / User Defined Assets have been in developement with the assistance of a dedicated team. Following the NU5 protocol upgrade they are significantly closer to fruition. Mechanisms for trustless & private cross-chain bridging of these assets enabling interoperability are currently in the works. A link to the Zcon3 presentation on this below.

The unequivocal advantage Zcash has over other existing smart contract platforms is it's natively private Layer 1. This completely removes any possibility of information leakage while using any Layer 2 applications. Allowing for a fundamentally simpler and more secure application layer that can permission access to information much easier.
